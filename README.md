### Further Work:
A useful development would be the ability to compare the metric cards between two different player selections (potentially expanding on the Top 15 available currently).
An introduction of a date hierachy may prove useful with the ability to then drill down on the spend by month visualisation. 
Visualations for the data of 'release date for the items purchased' and 'brand type' may also provide insights by further filtering the data.
