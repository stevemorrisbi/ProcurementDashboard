# Procurement Report
### Overview: This report was created to present and filter stock purchases from the United States in order to dictate future investment.

The metrics displayed were decided upon to to best help inform further procurement. Purchases need to fit in line with the current business model and price positioning in the market - ensuring a diversification across players and sports as well as keeping the average cost per item down. 

Date filtering was also a neccesity as it plays an important role in the timing of purchases. Times when certain sports are out of season or events hit peak viewership will influence the decision process behind certain stock being acquired.

The data is supplied as a CSV and was cleaned in Excel prior to being imported into Power BI. Numerous columns did not need visualising and these were removed in order to ensure maximum effiency in filtering back to the data source. 

The simple colour pallett for the design of this report is based on the branding website used for procurement.

### Further Work:
A useful development would be the ability to compare the metric cards between two different player selections (potentially expanding on the Top 15 available currently).
An introduction of a date hierachy may prove useful with the ability to then drill down on the spend by month visualisation. 
Visualations for the data of 'release date for the items purchased' and 'brand type' may also provide useful insights by further filtering the data.
