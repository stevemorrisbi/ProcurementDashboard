### Overview: This dashboard was created to present and filter stock purchases from the United States in order to dictate future investment.

Why is this COMC dashboard useful? 

Why were certain metrics decided?

How was the data cleaned? The data is supplied as a CSV and was cleaned in Excel prior to being imported into Power BI. There was a lot of collumns not needed to be visualised and these were removed in order to ensure maximum effiency in filtering back to the data source.

### Further Work:
A useful development would be the ability to compare the metric cards between two different player selections (potentially expanding on the Top 15 available currently).
An introduction of a date hierachy may prove useful with the ability to then drill down on the spend by month visualisation. 
Visualations for the data of 'release date for the items purchased' and 'brand type' may also provide insights by further filtering the data.
